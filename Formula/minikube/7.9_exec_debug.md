The exit code 126 indicates a "permission denied" error when trying to execute `netstat` in the `backend-deployment` Pod. This could mean that either the container's base image lacks `netstat`, or the command requires elevated privileges within the container.

Here are some steps to work around this issue and gather the information you need:

### 1. **Check for Installed Networking Tools**
   - Instead of `netstat`, try using `ss` (another network status command) if it’s available:
     ```sh
     kubectl exec -it backend-deployment-76f6887dd9-c5s8q -- ss -tuln | grep 8080
     ```
   - If `ss` is also unavailable, it’s likely that the container image doesn’t have networking utilities installed. You may need to add debugging tools to the image or troubleshoot by other means.

### 2. **Check Listening Ports Using an Alternative Command**
   - If you have `curl` or `wget` installed in the backend container, you could try a self-loopback test to see if the service is listening internally:
     ```sh
     kubectl exec -it backend-deployment-76f6887dd9-c5s8q -- curl http://localhost:8080
     ```
   - If the `curl` command is successful, it indicates that the application is running and listening on port 8080 within the container.

### 3. **Run a Debug Pod with Networking Tools**
   - If the base image of `backend-deployment` lacks network tools, you can deploy a temporary debug Pod in the same namespace with a networking-capable image (e.g., `nicolaka/netshoot` or `busybox`). This allows you to check network connectivity between the frontend and backend services.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     kubectl run debug-pod --rm -it --image=nicolaka/netshoot -- /bin/bash
     ```
   - From the debug Pod, you can run `curl http://backend-service:8080` to test connectivity to the `backend-service`.

### 4. **Verify Application Logs for Port Binding**
   - If the backend application isn’t listening on the expected port, it should show an error in the logs. You’ve already partially checked logs, but it might help to review them further for messages related to binding or networking.
