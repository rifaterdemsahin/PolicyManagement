#Works
kubectl auth can-i get pods --as=system:serviceaccount:default:dev-user


#Does not work 
kubectl exec frontend-pod -- wget --spider --timeout=1 backend-pod


Sure, let's break down the differences between these two commands and why one works while the other does not.

### Command 1: `kubectl auth can-i get pods --as=system:serviceaccount:default:dev-user`

This command checks if a specific service account (`dev-user` in the `default` namespace) has permission to perform a certain action (`get pods`). Here's a detailed explanation:

- **`kubectl auth can-i`**: This command is used to check if a user or service account has permission to perform a specific action.
- **`get pods`**: The action being checked is whether the service account can get (list or describe) pods.
- **`--as=system:serviceaccount:default:dev-user`**: This flag specifies that the check should be performed as the service account `dev-user` in the `default` namespace.

This command works because it is a straightforward permission check within Kubernetes' RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system. It doesn't involve interacting with any pods or services directly; it simply queries the Kubernetes API to see if the specified action is allowed.

### Command 2: `kubectl exec frontend-pod -- wget --spider --timeout=1 backend-pod`

This command attempts to execute a `wget` command inside the `frontend-pod` to check connectivity to `backend-pod`. Here's a detailed explanation:

- **`kubectl exec frontend-pod`**: This command is used to execute a command inside a running pod (`frontend-pod`).
- **`-- wget --spider --timeout=1 backend-pod`**: This part of the command specifies that `wget` should be used to check the connectivity to `backend-pod` with a timeout of 1 second.

### Why the Second Command Might Not Work

1. **DNS Resolution**: The name `backend-pod` might not resolve correctly. In Kubernetes, the full DNS name for a pod would typically be something like `backend-pod.default.svc.cluster.local`. If you are trying to reach a service, you should use the service name, not the pod name.

2. **Service vs. Pod**: If `backend-pod` is a pod and not a service, it might not be directly accessible by name. Pods are ephemeral and their IP addresses can change. It's better to use a service name which provides a stable endpoint.

3. **Network Policies**: There might be network policies in place that prevent `frontend-pod` from accessing `backend-pod`.

4. **Pod Readiness**: Ensure that `backend-pod` is running and ready to accept connections.

### Corrected Command

If `backend-pod` is actually a service, you should use the service name and include the namespace and domain:

```bash
kubectl exec frontend-pod -- wget --spider --timeout=1 backend-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8080
```

This command specifies the full DNS name and port (if needed) for the service, ensuring proper resolution and connectivity.
