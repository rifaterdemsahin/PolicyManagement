It looks like there are no pods running with the label `app=backend-service`. This could be the reason why your service is not able to connect, as there are no backend pods to handle the requests.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Deployment or StatefulSet**:
   - Ensure that the deployment or StatefulSet responsible for creating the backend pods is correctly configured and running:
     ```bash
     kubectl get deployments -l app=backend-service
     kubectl get statefulsets -l app=backend-service
     ```

2. **Inspect Deployment**:
   - If you have a deployment for the backend service, check its status:
     ```bash
     kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
     ```

3. **Check for Errors**:
   - Look for any errors or events that might indicate why the pods are not being created:
     ```bash
     kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
     ```

4. **Verify Pod Template**:
   - Ensure that the pod template in your deployment or StatefulSet has the correct labels and configuration:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: backend-service
     spec:
       replicas: 3
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: backend-service
       template:
         metadata:
           labels:
             app: backend-service
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: backend-container
             image: your-backend-image
             ports:
             - containerPort: 8080
     ```

5. **Create or Update Deployment**:
   - If the deployment does not exist or is misconfigured, create or update it:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yaml
     ```

### Example Deployment YAML

Here’s an example of a deployment YAML for the backend service:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend-service
  labels:
    app: backend-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backend-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend-container
        image: your-backend-image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

By ensuring that the backend pods are correctly deployed and running, your service should be able to route traffic to them successfully. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
