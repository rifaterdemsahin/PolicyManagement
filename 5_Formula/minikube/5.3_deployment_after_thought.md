If you have created or updated a deployment, Kubernetes will automatically manage the pods for you. However, if you need to manually restart the pods associated with a service, you can do so by deleting the pods, and Kubernetes will recreate them based on the deployment configuration.

Here are the steps to restart the pods:

1. **Get the List of Pods**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -l role=backend
   ```

   after delete
   ^C@rifaterdemsahin ➜ .../PolicyManagement/Symbols/Minikube/Test (main) $ kubectl get pods -l role=backend
NAME                               READY   STATUS        RESTARTS        AGE
backend-pod                        1/1     Terminating   5 (6m23s ago)   4h24m
backend-service-5f87676849-8qzbn   1/1     Terminating   0               2m56s
backend-service-5f87676849-cm22s   1/1     Running       0               27s
backend-service-5f87676849-lsdtl   1/1     Running       0               27s
backend-service-5f87676849-w49hk   1/1     Terminating   0               2m56s
backend-service-5f87676849-xjwt8   1/1     Terminating   0               2m56s
backend-service-5f87676849-xnzw5   1/1     Running       0               27s

2. **Delete the Pods**:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
   ```
   Repeat this command for each pod you want to restart. Alternatively, you can delete all pods with a specific label:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pods -l role=backend
   ```

3. **Verify Pods are Restarted**:
   Kubernetes will automatically recreate the pods based on the deployment configuration. You can verify the new pods are running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -l role=backend
   ```

   @rifaterdemsahin ➜ .../PolicyManagement/Symbols/Minikube/Test (main) $ kubectl get pods -l role=backend
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
backend-pod                        1/1     Running   5 (5m33s ago)   4h24m
backend-service-5f87676849-8qzbn   1/1     Running   0               2m6s
backend-service-5f87676849-w49hk   1/1     Running   0               2m6s
backend-service-5f87676849-xjwt8   1/1     Running   0               2m6s

### Example

If your deployment is named `backend-service` and the pods have the label `role=backend`, you can restart all pods with:
```bash
kubectl delete pods -l role=backend
```

@rifaterdemsahin ➜ .../PolicyManagement/Symbols/Minikube/Test (main) $ kubectl delete pods -l role=backend
pod "backend-pod" deleted
pod "backend-service-5f87676849-8qzbn" deleted
pod "backend-service-5f87676849-w49hk" deleted
pod "backend-service-5f87676849-xjwt8" deleted

Kubernetes will then recreate the pods according to the deployment specification.
