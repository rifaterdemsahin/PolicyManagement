# OpenShift Cluster Policy Management

## Overview

OpenShift Cluster Policy Management provides a framework for managing and enforcing policies across OpenShift clusters. It allows administrators to define, apply, and monitor policies that govern cluster behavior, resource utilization, security, and compliance. This tool helps organizations ensure that their OpenShift environments adhere to organizational standards and best practices.

## Features

- **Policy Definition**: Create custom policies using YAML or JSON formats.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automatically apply policies across clusters to ensure compliance.
- **Monitoring and Reporting**: Track policy violations and generate reports for compliance audits.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing OpenShift tools and workflows.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Manage user permissions and roles for policy management.

## Prerequisites

Before installing OpenShift Cluster Policy Management, ensure you have:

- Access to an OpenShift cluster.
- The `oc` command-line tool installed and configured.
- Sufficient permissions to create and manage resources in the cluster.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install OpenShift Cluster Policy Management:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/openshift-cluster-policy-management.git
   cd openshift-cluster-policy-management
   ```

2. **Deploy the Policy Management Operator**:
   ```bash
   oc apply -f deploy/operator.yaml
   ```

3. **Configure the Operator**:
   - Edit the `config.yaml` file to customize the settings.
   - Apply the configuration:
     ```bash
     oc apply -f config.yaml
     ```

4. **Verify the Installation**:
   Check the status of the operator:
   ```bash
   oc get pods -n policy-management
   ```

## Usage

### Creating a Policy

To create a new policy, define it in a YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.management.openshift.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: example-policy
spec:
  description: "An example policy for demonstration purposes"
  rules:
    - apiGroups: ["*"]
      resources: ["pods"]
      verbs: ["create", "update"]
```

Apply the policy:

```bash
oc apply -f example-policy.yaml
```

### Monitoring Policies

To view the status of your policies:

```bash
oc get policies
```

For detailed information about a specific policy:

```bash
oc describe policy example-policy
```

## Reporting Violations

Policy violations can be viewed in the OpenShift console or via the command line:

```bash
oc get policyviolations
```
