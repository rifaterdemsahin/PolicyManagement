It looks like the issue is with the DNS resolution for the `backend-pod.default.svc.cluster.local` address. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **CoreDNS Status**: Ensure that the CoreDNS pods are running properly. You can see that the `coredns` pod is running in the `kube-system` namespace, but double-check for any errors in its logs:
   ```sh
   kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns
   ```

2. **Service and Endpoints**: Verify that the service for `backend-pod` is correctly set up and that it has the right endpoints:
   ```sh
   kubectl get svc backend-pod
   kubectl get endpoints backend-pod
   ```

3. **Network Policies**: Ensure there are no network policies that might be blocking the DNS resolution or communication between the pods.

4. **Pod DNS Configuration**: Check the DNS configuration of the `frontend-pod` to ensure it is correctly set up to use the cluster DNS:
   ```sh
   kubectl exec frontend-pod -- cat /etc/resolv.conf
   ```

5. **Cluster DNS IP**: Ensure that the DNS IP in the `resolv.conf` matches the ClusterIP of the `kube-dns` service.

If everything seems correct and the issue persists, you might want to restart the CoreDNS pods to see if that resolves the issue:
```sh
kubectl rollout restart deployment coredns -n kube-system
```
